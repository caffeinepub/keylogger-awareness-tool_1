  "summary": "The diff implements 8 out of 10 requirements. REQ-1 (authentication security) and REQ-5 (backend access control) are missing. REQ-7 (React Query race conditions) lacks evidence. The backend file shows only an empty actor. All other requirements appear implemented with input sanitization, localStorage validation, error boundaries, accessibility improvements, and memory leak fixes.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Review and fix authentication security vulnerabilities in the Internet Identity integration, including session management, token validation, and secure logout flow",
      "reason": "No changes to authentication-related files. The constraint prohibited modifying useInternetIdentity.ts, but REQ-1 still required reviewing and fixing authentication vulnerabilities elsewhere. No evidence of token validation, session expiration handling, or secure logout implementation in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Audit the backend actor for missing access control checks and implement proper authorization guards for all public methods",
